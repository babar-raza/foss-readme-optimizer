# Post-POC backlog

- 2026-08-09: poc runner failed for aspose-html-foss/Aspose.HTML-FOSS-for-Python: ValueError: verified template lacks required capability, acquisition, or example facts
- 2026-08-09: aspose-html-foss/Aspose.HTML-FOSS-for-Python cannot deliver a verified README:
  its pyproject.toml declares `build-backend = "setuptools.backends.legacy:build"`, a module
  that does not exist in setuptools, so every `pip install .` fails before building and the
  acquisition/example proofs stay blocked. Upstream one-line fix: use
  `build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"` (as every other portfolio repo does), then re-run
  `readme-agent poc --repo aspose-html-foss/Aspose.HTML-FOSS-for-Python`.
