# Aspose.3D FOSS for Java

A free and open-source implementation of Aspose.3D for Java, released under the permissive **MIT License**. It provides an API-compatible, open-source alternative for working with 3D scenes and models in Java, maintaining the `com.aspose.threed.*` package structure of the commercial library.

## At a glance

- **For:** Java developers building 3D import, export, and scene-processing applications.
- **Problem solved:** Create, load, inspect, transform, and save 3D scenes with an open-source Java API.
- **Verified capabilities:** Create, load, inspect, transform, and save 3D scenes with an open-source Java API.

## Installation

Install the package published for this repository:

```xml
<dependency>

The coordinate was verified against Maven Central.

## About Aspose.3D FOSS

Aspose.3D FOSS is the free, open-source edition of Aspose.3D. It shares the same public API design as the commercial Aspose.3D On-Premise library, so you can:

- **Build and ship 3D applications at no cost** under a permissive MIT License.
- **Start free and grow without rewriting code** — code written against the FOSS edition works with the commercial edition.
- **Upgrade only when you need to** — when you require the broader feature set, higher performance, rendering, or proprietary format support of the [commercial On-Premise edition](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java/), simply swap in the commercial package, no API rewrites required.

The FOSS edition focuses on the most widely used open 3D formats. The commercial edition additionally covers proprietary and high-performance scenarios such as rendering, advanced mesh operations, and formats like USD, PDF, A3DW, JT, and more.

## Project Status

This is a work-in-progress port. See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for current progress and [FILE_FORMATS.md](FILE_FORMATS.md) for format support status.

## API Compatibility

The public API matches Aspose.3D for Java 26.1.0:
- Package structure: `com.aspose.threed.*`
- Method signatures: Identical to Aspose.3D
- Class names: Same as Aspose.3D

**Excluded APIs:**
- No licensing, trial, or DRM-related functionality (not applicable to an open-source project)
- Some advanced features have stub implementations

## Building

This is a Maven project. Build and test with:

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run tests
mvn test
```

## Usage

### Minimal verified example

```java
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;

public class ReadmeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Scene scene = new Scene();
        scene.save("scene.stl");
    }
}
```

This exact example was compiled against the source build at revision `8de5f467e93138b3605acdc46ca40e93f0364ee8`.
