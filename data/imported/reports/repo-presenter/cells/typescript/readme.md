[![Aspose.Cells FOSS for TypeScript](https://products.aspose.org/media/cells/typescript/banner-readme.png)](https://products.aspose.org/cells/typescript/)

Aspose.Cells FOSS for TypeScript is a free, open-source TypeScript library for creating,
loading, editing, and saving Excel `.xlsx` (Office Open XML / SpreadsheetML) workbooks
without requiring Microsoft Excel. It exposes an Aspose.Cells-compatible API surface —
`Workbook`, `Worksheet`, `Cell`, `Style` — and additionally reads and writes HTML, and
exports to CSV, JSON, and Markdown for reporting and data-interchange scenarios.

## Key Capabilities

- Load and save `.xlsx` workbooks — `Workbook.load(filePath)` reads an existing file
  (auto-detecting HTML too), and `Workbook.save(filePath, options)` writes it back out.
- Read and write cell values, formulas, and shared strings via `Cell.putValue()`/
  `Cell.setFormula()`, with `Worksheet.getCell2()`/`getCell()` lookups by reference or
  coordinate.
- Apply full style formatting — font, fill, border, alignment, and number formats — through
  `Style`, `Font`, `Fill`, `Border`, and `Alignment`, set per cell via `Cell.setStyle()`.
- Configure worksheet-level settings: column widths, row heights, merged cells, auto filter,
  and hidden rows, all through `Worksheet` methods.
- Add hyperlinks and defined names, and apply data validation and conditional formatting
  rules to a range.
- Access embedded pictures and shapes through `Workbook.images` (`ImageInfo[]`) and
  `Worksheet.shapes` (`ShapeInfo[]`).
- Import and export HTML — `Workbook.load()` recognizes `.html`/`.htm` files and converts
  them into a workbook object, and `toHtml()` renders a workbook to a styled HTML document.
- Export a workbook as text — `toCsv()`, `toJson()`, and `toMarkdown()` each return the
  workbook's data as a string, ready to write to a file or hand to another process directly.

## Installation

A npm package has not been published yet. Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aspose-cells-foss/Aspose.Cells-FOSS-for-TypeScript.git
cd Aspose.Cells-FOSS-for-TypeScript
npm install
```

## Dependencies

### Required Package Dependencies

- `@zip.js/zip.js` ^2.8.21 — reads and writes the XLSX ZIP container.
- `@xmldom/xmldom` ^0.8.10 — parses and serializes the OOXML part XML.
- `adm-zip` ^0.5.16 — used alongside `@zip.js/zip.js` for ZIP entry handling.

### Native and System Requirements

- Requires Node.js 18 or later and TypeScript 5 or later.

### Development Dependencies

- `@types/node` ^25.3.3, `typescript` ^5.9.3 — TypeScript compilation and type checking.
- `ts-node` ^10.9.2, `tsx` ^4.21.0 — running TypeScript examples/tests directly.

## Quick Start

Create a workbook, write typed values and a formula, style a header row, and save it as
XLSX:

```typescript
import { Workbook, Style } from "./aspose_cells";

const workbook = new Workbook();
const sheet = workbook.worksheets.get(0)!;

sheet.name = "Products";
sheet.putValue("A1", "Product");
sheet.putValue("B1", "Price");
sheet.putValue("A2", "Apple");
sheet.putValue("B2", 2.99);
sheet.putValue("A3", "Orange");
sheet.putValue("B3", 1.99);
const cellB4 = sheet.getCell2("B4");
cellB4.setFormula("=SUM(B2:B3)");

const headerStyle = new Style();
headerStyle.setBold(true);
headerStyle.setFontColor("FFFFFFFF");
headerStyle.setForegroundColor("FF2278D4");

sheet.getCell2("A1").setStyle(headerStyle);
sheet.getCell2("B1").setStyle(headerStyle);

await workbook.save("products.xlsx");
```

Load an existing workbook, update a cell, and save it back:

```typescript
import { Workbook } from "./aspose_cells";

const workbook = await Workbook.load("input.xlsx");
const sheet = workbook.worksheets.get(0)!;

sheet.getCell2("A1").putValue("Updated");

await workbook.save("updated.xlsx");
```

## API Reference

The library ships a real class surface centered on `Workbook`, `Worksheet`, `Cell`, and
`Style` — `Workbook.worksheets` is a `WorksheetCollection` of `Worksheet` objects, each
exposing a `Cells` collection for reading and writing values, formulas, and styles.

## Scope and Limitations

- Text export is available as a returned string, not as a direct file-write helper — pass
  the result of `toCsv()`, `toJson()`, or `toMarkdown()` to your own file-writing code.
- Text export is one-way — there is no corresponding import path back into a `Workbook`.

These limitations do not apply to the commercial
[Aspose.Cells — Enterprise Edition](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) product family, which
adds a full commercial spreadsheet engine, broader format coverage, and active support beyond
this FOSS TypeScript edition's own scope.

## Development and Testing

Build and type-check from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit
```
