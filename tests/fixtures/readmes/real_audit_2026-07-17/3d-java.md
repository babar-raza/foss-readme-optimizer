# Aspose.3D FOSS for Java

A free and open-source implementation of Aspose.3D for Java, released under the permissive **MIT License**. It provides an API-compatible, open-source alternative for working with 3D scenes and models in Java, maintaining the `com.aspose.threed.*` package structure of the commercial library.

> 🏠 **Aspose.3D FOSS** lives on [aspose.org](https://products.aspose.org/3d/java/) — Aspose's home for free, open-source file-format libraries. The full commercial edition, [Aspose.3D for Java](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java/), is available on [aspose.com](https://products.aspose.com/3d).

## About Aspose.3D FOSS

Aspose.3D FOSS is the free, open-source edition of Aspose.3D. It shares the same public API design as the commercial Aspose.3D On-Premise library, so you can:

- **Build and ship 3D applications at no cost** under a permissive MIT License.
- **Start free and grow without rewriting code** — code written against the FOSS edition works with the commercial edition.
- **Upgrade only when you need to** — when you require the broader feature set, higher performance, rendering, or proprietary format support of the [commercial On-Premise edition](https://products.aspose.com/3d/java/), simply swap in the commercial package, no API rewrites required.

The FOSS edition focuses on the most widely used open 3D formats. The commercial edition additionally covers proprietary and high-performance scenarios such as rendering, advanced mesh operations, and formats like USD, PDF, A3DW, JT, and more.

## Project Status

This is a work-in-progress port. See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for current progress and [FILE_FORMATS.md](FILE_FORMATS.md) for format support status.

## API Compatibility

The public API matches Aspose.3D for Java 26.1.0:
- Package structure: `com.aspose.threed.*`
- Method signatures: Identical to Aspose.3D
- Class names: Same as Aspose.3D

**Excluded APIs:**
- No licensing, trial, or DRM-related functionality (not applicable to an open-source project)
- Some advanced features have stub implementations

## Building

This is a Maven project. Build and test with:

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run tests
mvn test
```

## Usage

```java
import com.aspose.threed.Scene;

// Load a 3D file
Scene scene = new Scene("testdata/input/cube.obj");

// Save to another format
scene.save("output.stl");
```
