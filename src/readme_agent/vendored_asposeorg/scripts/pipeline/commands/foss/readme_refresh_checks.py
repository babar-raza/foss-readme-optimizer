"""CONTRACT: deterministic checks for the /readme-refresh skill (plan:
<redacted local development-machine path, not part of the vendored contract>).

Full checks module for the /readme-refresh skill (S-ID assigned at registration; see
skills/readme-refresh.md), called from readme_refresh_run.py's ingest-candidate/recheck/push
subcommands. Two tiers throughout, consistent across every function below:
  - HARD GATE: a non-empty/True result blocks the state-machine transition. Used only where
    the check is genuinely unambiguous (a link target either exists on disk or doesn't; a
    command either matches upstream-issues.md's exact BLOCKING text or doesn't).
  - HEURISTIC / TWO-TIER: a non-empty result is a prompt for the mandatory human/agent
    judgment pass, never an automatic fail. Used wherever "is this actually a problem" is a
    content-quality judgment call a script can't fully automate (tone, member-list accuracy,
    diagram node duplication).

Diagram checks (Mermaid "## At a glance" flowchart, all real, implemented, hard-gate or
heuristic per function): check_diagram_connectivity() [hard gate], check_diagram_known_
subgraph_ids() [heuristic], check_diagram_matches_capability_dependencies() [hard gate once a
product has a data/diagram_capability_dependencies.json entry], check_diagram_suspicious_
direct_product_edge() [heuristic], check_diagram_capability_unreachable_from_product()
[heuristic], check_diagram_no_mechanism_duplicate_output() [heuristic], and check_only_
mermaid_block_changed() [hard gate for mermaid-only refresh runs].

Content checks (whole-README, all real, implemented): compute_link_caps(), count_aspose_
links(), check_enterprise_edition_naming() [heuristic], check_required_sections() [hard gate],
surgical_diff_check() [hard gate], check_license_link_target() [hard gate], check_process_
narration_smells() [heuristic], check_no_undisclosed_blocking_commands() [hard gate],
check_dropped_content() [hard gate at ingest-candidate -- a flagged link/heading needs an
explicit disposition in content-dispositions.json before the transition can pass; see the
content-unit checks below for prose-level coverage, which this link/heading-only check does
not itself provide], check_no_excluded_domain_links() [hard gate], check_named_member_accuracy()
[heuristic -- see its own docstring for an honest statement of what this heuristic
implementation can and cannot verify, versus the full per-language compiler-grade extraction the
plan's Verification pass section describes], check_api_reference_intro_names_classes()
[heuristic].

Old-README content-unit checks (Fifteenth incident / MT030, 2026-08-09 -- verify-and-merge of
real old-README prose beyond check_dropped_content's link/heading-only scope): extract_old_
readme_content_units() [pure extraction, not a check], check_content_unit_disposition_coverage()
[hard gate], check_content_unit_evidence_resolves() [hard gate], check_content_unit_merged_
into_target_section() [hard gate], check_content_unit_no_exact_duplicate_merge() [hard gate],
check_content_unit_classification_plausibility() [heuristic], check_content_unit_probable_
duplicate() [heuristic]. `dropped_claims.json`, referenced only as a docstring aspiration
throughout this module's history (2026-08-04 through 2026-08-09) and never actually
implemented by any code, is superseded by the real `content-dispositions.json` artifact these
checks read and write against -- see check_content_unit_disposition_coverage's own docstring.

check_diagram_matches_capability_dependencies (spec'd 2026-08-06, plan section
"Capability-dependency edges") is a hard gate once a product has a recorded
pipeline_edges list (data/diagram_capability_dependencies.json) -- a no-op,
always-pass when pipeline_edges is None (nothing recorded to contradict).
Compares the drawn diagram's edges against the recorded [from, to] pairs:
every recorded pair must have a real from---to edge, `to` must not also carry
a direct PRODUCT---to edge (the barcode/python C5/C6 contradiction this exists
to catch), and any drawn Capability-to-Capability edge absent from the record
is flagged as undeclared (either a real find not yet recorded, or drift).

check_diagram_suspicious_direct_product_edge and
check_diagram_capability_unreachable_from_product (both spec'd 2026-08-06) are
heuristic, non-blocking tripwires. The former flags a Capabilities node wired
both directly from PRODUCT and from a sibling Capability -- the contradictory
double-path shape found live in barcode/python's 2026-08-05 fix (honest recall:
catches only defects with *some* existing Capability-to-Capability edge to
contradict, not the far more common "edge simply never drawn" shape). The
latter flags a Capabilities node with zero inbound edges from PRODUCT or a
sibling Capability -- a regression tripwire for future edits, harmless no-op
against pre-fix diagrams.

check_only_mermaid_block_changed (spec'd 2026-08-06, "Hardened design" section
-- the mermaid-only-refresh enforcement mechanism) extracts the full fenced
```mermaid ... ``` block (fences included) from both an old and new copy of a
README, replaces it with a fixed placeholder in each, and asserts the
remainder is byte-identical. This is the mechanical gate for "a diagram
refresh must touch only the diagram" -- it exists specifically because no
such mechanism existed anywhere in this repo before, and this session already
observed 5 of 8 parallel agents pick up a contaminated pre-edit snapshot once
(a different, complementary risk this check does not itself prevent -- it
only catches a bad *result*, not a bad starting snapshot).

check_diagram_known_subgraph_ids (spec'd 2026-08-06, plan section "Archetype-aware
structure and content rules") is a non-blocking tripwire: flags any `## At a glance`
subgraph ID outside the canonical set {Inputs, FromScratch, Capabilities, Outputs}
-- either a typo'd canonical ID or a genuinely new archetype shape not yet added to
the canonical set. check_diagram_connectivity's ID-based classifier (below) is a
strict allow-list, so an unrecognized ID would otherwise silently drop out of
connectivity checking rather than erroring; this check exists specifically to
surface that silent-drop case for human/agent judgment, never an automatic fail.

check_diagram_no_mechanism_duplicate_output (spec'd 2026-08-05, plan section
"Never split one output artifact into multiple Output nodes purely by
delivery mechanism") is a heuristic pre-filter, two-tier like the other
2026-08-05 checks: it flags any pair of `## At a glance` Output nodes whose
labels share a significant word and where at least one label contains a
delivery-mechanism keyword (path/stream/buffer/bytes/in-memory/file) while
their inbound Capability-edge sets differ. Found live via direct user review
of cells/cpp's rendered GitHub diagram: `.xlsx workbook (path)` and `.xlsx
workbook (binary stream)` were split into two Output nodes, but the stream
variant was wired from only 1 of 5 Capability nodes, falsely implying only
that one capability's work could be stream-saved -- when in reality path vs.
stream is an orthogonal Save() I/O mechanism, unrelated to which capability
populated the workbook. cells/rust had the same defect, worse (3 delivery
variants, 2 gated to a single capability). A portfolio-wide mechanical
pre-filter + manual review confirmed these were the only 2 of 30 files with
this exact defect -- several near-misses (3d/net, cells/python, email/cpp,
email/net, email/python) were checked and confirmed to be genuinely
different output *content*, not mechanism duplicates, and correctly left
alone. A hit is a prompt for the mandatory judgment pass ("same artifact,
different mechanism" vs. "genuinely different content"), never an automatic
fail.

check_api_reference_intro_names_classes (spec'd 2026-08-05, plan section "API
reference intro sentence must name real hub classes") is a cheap regex
tripwire, two-tier like check_process_narration_smells: it flags the
"## API reference" intro sentence (the text between the H2 heading and its
`<details>` fold) when it matches either confirmed bad form -- a bare
"ships N public types. Selected entry points:" filler, or a bare
`namespace.*`/`package.*` wildcard with no backtick-quoted class name in the
same sentence -- as a prompt for the mandatory judgment pass to rewrite it
naming the product's real hub class(es), never an automatic fail (naming a
real hub class is a content-quality judgment call, not mechanically
decidable). Found live on direct user review of 3d/net's rendered GitHub PR
page: the section read as nearly empty (one generic sentence, then everything
real hidden behind a single `<details>` fold with zero class names visible).
A read-only 30-file survey run in response confirmed this is inconsistent
portfolio-wide, not a 3d/net-specific defect -- 9 of 30 files have the weak
pattern (3d/net, pdf/net, cells/net, 3d/java, cells/java, slides/java,
email/net, note/python, 3d/python) while the other 21 already name real hub
classes correctly (e.g. cells/cpp: "The primary entry point is `Workbook`,
which owns a `WorksheetCollection` of `Worksheet` objects.").

check_named_member_accuracy (spec'd 2026-08-05, plan section "Named-member API
claims must be individually verified against real source") is the newest spec'd
check -- it targets a defect class check_dropped_content cannot see: a README
bullet of the form "`ClassName` -- `member1`, `member2`, ..." can name a real,
present class while still listing a wrong member set (a member that doesn't
exist on the real class, or a combined Load/Save-style bullet that's silently
just one side's property list). This was found live in 3d/python's "Format
load/save options" API reference subsection -- ObjSaveOptions had 5 real
Save-only properties silently missing from a combined bullet, and a glTF bullet
claimed an `export_textures` property that exists on neither real class.
check_dropped_content only tests presence (does old topic X still appear
somewhere); this checks accuracy (is the specific technical claim about a
present topic actually true of the real source) -- a different failure mode
needing a different check, not wider coverage of the same one.

check_diagram_connectivity parses the ```mermaid flowchart``` block in a README,
classifies each `subgraph` by its ID (Inputs / FromScratch / Capabilities / Outputs
-- changed 2026-08-06 from classifying by label text, see below), and verifies
every node declared inside the Capabilities subgraph has a path (via the diagram's
edges) to at least one node in the Outputs subgraph. A capability node with no such
path is an "orphan" -- the diagram visually claims the capability exists but never
shows it producing anything.

This check is purely structural. It cannot tell whether a node's claim is true
(fabricated node) or stale (correct at generation time, false after a later
correction) -- those require comparing against the README's own Key Capabilities /
Scope and limitations sections and the paired upstream-issues.md, which stays
agent judgment, not a script.

ID-based classification (2026-08-06): originally this classified by matching
substrings ("input"/"capabilit"/"output") in the subgraph's display LABEL text.
That stopped being a safe signal once the plan's archetype system (Template
section, "Archetype-aware structure and content rules") started allowing display
labels to vary per product archetype -- e.g. a generative product's Inputs
subgraph is titled "Input data and options", not "Inputs and formats". The
subgraph ID (`subgraph Inputs[...]` -- the bare word before the `[`) stays a
stable, non-prose anchor regardless of what the label says, so classification now
keys off group(1) (the ID) instead of group(2) (the label). Verified backward
compatible against the full 30-file corpus before this landed: every existing
diagram already writes an ID that equals its own label text verbatim, so this is
a no-op for all pre-existing files. `Inputs` and `FromScratch` (the new subgraph
a hybrid-archetype product's diagram may add, per the Template section) are both
classified into a single "source" bucket -- the connectivity check's BFS logic
never enumerated Inputs subgraphs in the first place (it only walks forward from
Capabilities to Outputs), so folding FromScratch into the same bucket needed no
change to that logic, only to classification.

    Parenthetical qualifiers are deliberately NOT checked -- validated directly against the
    real corpus that motivated this check: every legitimate qualifier found there (`"(file path

    the product genuinely producing all three -- `PdfWriter`/`DviWriter`/`SvgWriter` are real,
    confirmed classes), missing rows for a product's own primary format (`pdf/cpp` has no PDF or
    PNG row at all; `html/python` has no HTML row), spurious rows (`html/python`'s `BLOB`/
    `START`), and direct self-contradiction against the same file's own prose (`3d/net`'s
    formats.md claims PLY Export=Yes while the file's own intro and Key Capabilities both
    explicitly say "PLY is import-only"). `readme-refresh` cannot fix that upstream extractor
    from its own layer (a different skill's territory -- repo-scout/knowledge-enrich), so this
    must be permanently robust to formats.md being wrong in either direction, not contingent on
    someone else fixing it.

    the retired function, this does not check Capabilities nodes, where a format mention's

       matching this function's own name; deliberately not `backlink_targets.py`'s
       "Enterprise Product"/"Enterprise Product Family" phrasing, a different convention
       for a different consumer: docs/kb/reference/products pages, not GitHub READMEs).
       Confirmed live 3-way drift across a 6-file sample this decision closes: "Enterprise
       Edition" (majority), "Enterprise Product" (`pdf/cpp`, `cells/cpp`), and no qualifier
       at all (`words/net`, a real gap).
    2. **Context** (2026-08-08, Rule 4 -- "the anchor explains access to broader/full
       product functionality, rather than using a naked brand or promotional CTA"): the
       ~120 characters surrounding the link must contain language explaining what broader
       functionality is gained (a `broader`/`full`/`complete`/`additional`/`advanced`/
       `commercial` word near a `functionality`/`feature`/`format`/`support`/`coverage`/
       `capability` word) -- distinguishing a real explanatory sentence from a bare "See
       [Enterprise Edition](...)" CTA with no stated reason to click.

    Findings carry a "reason" of "missing_naming", "missing_context", or both (as separate
    findings) so a caller can tell which half failed. Hard gate for naming (mechanically
    unambiguous once the standard is decided); the context half stays a heuristic prompt,
    since "does this sentence really explain the value" is a content-quality judgment call.

    """Heuristic (2026-08-12, TC-HARDEN-32, MT035) -- NOT a hard gate; see below for why.
    No prior check anywhere verified the composed `## Installation` section against real
    package/install data -- `_detect_install_info`'s factpack signal (`published`/
    `fallback_text_required`) was computed but never read back against the section's actual
    composed text, a real portfolio-wide gap, maximally exposed for a genuinely new product
    (guaranteed to have no `data/package_registry.json` entry yet).

    Two directions, matching this plan's own established "never invent a URL/version/command
    not backed by verified data" rule:

    1. **Unpublished (`fallback_text_required: True`)**: the section should disclose this using
       one of the real, already-established portfolio conventions (see
       `_UNPUBLISHED_PACKAGE_SIGNAL_RE`) -- never a specific install command presented as if a
       real package exists.
    2. **Published (`fallback_text_required: False`)**: the section should name the real,
       confirmed package identity from `data/package_registry.json`'s own `candidate` field
       (case-insensitively -- see below) -- `artifact_id` for Maven (the identifier actually
       used in a real dependency declaration, not `group_id`), `module_path` for Go modules,
       `name` for every other registry type (PyPI/NuGet/npm/crates.io).

    **Why this is a heuristic, not a hard gate -- confirmed by direct, live evidence the moment
    this check was first run against real content, not a theoretical caveat**: `data/
    package_registry.json` was found to be independently wrong, in BOTH directions, for real
    products already in this portfolio. `words/net`'s entry reads `published: false`, but the
    real, live NuGet API (`api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/aspose.words.foss/index.json`)
    confirms `Aspose.Words.FOSS` v26.2.0 genuinely IS published right now -- the registry's own
    `published` flag is stale relative to the real world (and relative to the README's own
    already-correct `dotnet add package Aspose.Words.FOSS` content, which is right). `email/
    net`'s `candidate.name` is `"Aspose.Email.FOSS"`, but the real, live nuspec
    (`aspose.email.foss.nuspec`) confirms the actual published package ID's real casing is
    `Aspose.Email.Foss` -- matching the README's own already-correct content, not the registry.
    This is the identical "even structured, real, checked-in data isn't infallible" lesson
    `formats.md` already taught this plan (MT025's Twelfth incident) -- a hard gate here would
    have blocked two ALREADY-CORRECT candidates over stale registry data, exactly the mistake
    that lesson exists to prevent. The package-identity comparison is also case-insensitive for
    the same reason (both confirmed real NuGet-casing mismatches were case-only) -- NuGet/PyPI/
    npm package IDs are conventionally case-insensitive anyway, so an exact-case match was never
    the right bar for "is this the right package," only a distraction from it.

    Degrades gracefully, never a finding on its own: no `## Installation` section
    (`check_required_sections` already owns that), no real registry data at all for this
    product, or incomplete `candidate` data (nothing to compare against) all return no findings.

    MT042 (TC-HARDEN-59, Thirty-Second incident, 2026-08-14): also scans the CANDIDATE's badge
    row (independent of the `## Installation` section, and of whether that section exists at
    all) for a `package_version`-category badge, and verifies its claimed identity against the
    exact same `install_info["candidate"]` data -- extending this already-hardened check to a
    second real consumer rather than building a parallel mechanism from scratch, per this
    module's own established discipline ("does this improve results without weakening what
    already works"). Same case-insensitive comparison, same disclosed `data/package_registry.
    json`-reliability caveat above, so this stays folded into the same heuristic, not a new
    hard gate.

    Returns `{"reason", "expected"?}` findings -- a prompt for human/agent judgment (matching
    this module's other data-source-dependent heuristics, e.g. `check_diagram_format_
    completeness_hint`), never an automatic fail.

    `` - `create(subject, body) -> "MapiMessage"` ``, or a single `properties: `a`, `b`, `c`
    ``-style comma line) -- does every member named in those sub-bullets plausibly exist on the
    named class's real source?

    Deliberately does NOT treat a bare single-line "`ClassName` — prose mentioning `a_term()`"
    bullet (no indented sub-bullets following it, e.g. an Exceptions-list one-liner) as a
    member-list claim -- confirmed via a real false-positive during this function's own
    development (barcode/python's "`SymbologyNotFoundError` — unknown symbology name passed to
    `generate()`" is a description, not a claim that `generate()` is SymbologyNotFoundError's
    own member; only genuinely indented sub-bullets count as the member list).

    HONEST SCOPE STATEMENT (do not treat a clean pass from this function as compiler-grade
    proof): this is a grep-based heuristic, not the full per-language extraction the plan's
    Verification pass section describes (`javap -public` for Java, real introspection for
    Python, compiler diagnostics for C#/Go/Rust/C++, `tsc` for TypeScript). It locates
    candidate source files for a named class via a simple `class ClassName`/`struct
    ClassName`/`interface ClassName` grep across clone_cache_root, then checks whether each
    named member token appears anywhere in that file's text. This can miss real member-name
    typos hidden by fuzzy matching, can under-report on classes split across multiple files
    (partial classes, extension methods, trait impls), and does NOT trace inheritance -- a
    member declared once on a base class and inherited (confirmed live: words/net's
    `Document.GetText()`, real and callable, declared only on the base `Node` class) will be
    flagged as "not found" even though it's genuinely valid. A member absent from every
    candidate file is a real, worth-flagging signal, but presence in the file text is not proof
    the member is real, public, and matches the exact bullet's claimed shape. Treat every
    finding as a prompt for the same real per-language verification this check cannot fully
    automate, never as a substitute for it.

    Returns a list of {"class_name", "member", "reason"} findings for members not found in any
    candidate source file for their class. Returns [] (not an error) if a class name has zero
    candidate source files -- that's a "couldn't verify" case for the human/agent pass, not a
    fabrication claim this heuristic can respons­ibly make on no evidence.

    `reference_dir` (added 2026-08-09, MT027): the directory `content/reference.aspose.org/en/
    {family}/{platform}/`, if given. When a partial-class page (`{reference_dir}/{ClassName}.md`)
    exists for a cited class, it becomes the PREFERRED evidence source for that class -- real,
    already-graded `## Properties`/`## Methods` tables (`parse_reference_class_page`) instead of
    a raw clone-cache grep, since a real signature/property table is stronger evidence than
    "this token appears somewhere in the file's text." The clone-cache-grep path stays the
    fallback for any class with no reference-site page, exactly matching MT025's own "primary
    signal, cheaper fallback" precedent for `api_surface.json` vs. clone-cache filename search.
    `None` (the default) preserves this function's exact prior behavior, unchanged.

    deliberate, bounded widening (exactly these languages, not an open-ended "any extension"

# check_api_reference_intro_names_classes (2026-08-05) was RETIRED 2026-08-09 (MT027) --
# absorbed into check_api_reference_classes_exist_in_reference_site (below), which runs the
# same two bad-pattern checks PLUS real class-name verification against reference.aspose.org,
# and was elevated from heuristic to hard gate now that class-name verification makes the
# underlying question mechanically decidable. See that function's docstring for the full
# rationale. _API_REF_SECTION_RE (the intro-only section extractor) is kept -- still used there.
# Re-bound 2026-08-15 (MT045, Thirty-Fifth incident, TC-HARDEN-67): was `(?=<details>|\Z)`,
# which silently over-captures the ENTIRE remainder of the document as "the intro sentence
# region" whenever no `<details>` tag exists in the file at all -- confirmed live against
# barcode/python's real defective (uncollapsed) text, which captured all 5115 remaining
# characters. Re-bound to ALSO stop at the next `##` heading (whichever of `<details>`/next
# heading/EOF comes first) -- a strict superset of the old boundary, so a candidate that
# still has its `<details>` tag (the common, already-correct case) is completely unaffected
# (confirmed by the existing `test_check_api_reference_classes_flags_bare_wildcard` fixture,
# which has no other `##` heading and depends on the intro region stopping exactly at
# `<details>`, not at EOF); only the previously-unbounded no-`<details>`-anywhere case is
# newly, correctly bounded. Defensive: becomes structurally unreachable for a candidate that
# also passes `check_api_reference_detail_collapsed` (which requires a real `<details>` tag
# to exist), but guards a still-failing candidate mid-iteration.

    """Hard gate (2026-08-09, MT027; absorbs the retired `check_api_reference_intro_names_
    classes`, 2026-08-05). Two checks on the `## API Reference` section, combined into one
    function because both answer the same underlying question -- "is this section's naming of
    real classes trustworthy" -- at two different strengths:

    1. **Bad-pattern detection** (the original 2026-08-05 heuristic, unchanged logic): the
       section's intro sentence must not be a bare "ships N public types. Selected entry
       points:" filler, nor a bare trailing `namespace.*`/`package.*` wildcard with no other
       backtick-quoted class name elsewhere in the sentence.
    2. **Real class-name verification** (new, 2026-08-09): every class name cited anywhere in
       the section (the established `` - `ClassName` [— description] `` bullet convention, plus
       any backtick-quoted PascalCase token in the intro sentence) must be confirmed by AT LEAST
       ONE of two independent real sources: this product's own `reference.aspose.org` class
       index (`reference_class_names`, the flattened `parse_reference_api_index` output), or a
       real class/struct/interface declaration in the clone-cache source (`clone_cache_root`,
       reusing `_find_class_source_files` -- the same lookup `check_named_member_accuracy`
       already uses). This is strictly stronger than (1): a sentence can pass the bad-pattern
       check by naming a class, while that class is fabricated -- (1) alone would never catch
       that; this closes the gap, extending this plan's "fabricated capability is the single
       worst defect class" principle (already enforced for diagram nodes and format claims) to
       API Reference class citations.

       **Two sources, not one, found live during this function's own Phase 1 pilot sanity pass
       (2026-08-09) -- not assumed correct on the first design.** A single-source design
       (reference-index-only) produced real false positives: `tex/python`'s `FontManager`/
       `FontMetrics`/`InputSource` and `pdf/cpp`'s `IIndexBitmapConverter`/`Pages` are genuine,
       already-source-verified real classes (confirmed during this plan's own earlier
       Verification-pass work) that simply don't appear in `reference.aspose.org`'s own
       generated index for those products -- real coverage gaps in an otherwise-graded source,
       the same "even structured/graded content isn't infallible" lesson `formats.md` already
       taught this plan (MT025's Twelfth incident), now confirmed to recur for reference-site
       coverage too. A class is only flagged as fabricated when NEITHER source confirms it.

    Elevated from (1)'s original heuristic status to a full hard gate now that (2), with its
    two-source corroboration, makes "is a named class real" reliably decidable, not just a
    content-quality judgment call -- the same class of elevation this plan already gave
    `check_process_narration_smells`.

    Class-name verification degrades gracefully when ONE source is unavailable:
    `reference_class_names` empty/`None` and/or `clone_cache_root` absent/not-a-directory simply
    removes that source from consideration (never a hard failure on its own).

    **When BOTH sources are absent (TC-HARDEN-31, Twenty-Second incident / MT035) -- the
    guaranteed starting state of any genuinely new product, before `/repo-scout` has ever run
    and before a `reference.aspose.org` page exists -- this no longer silently skips
    verification.** The prior behavior produced zero findings for a section naming any number
    of classes, indistinguishable from "verified clean," exactly when this hard gate's real
    defenses (this function and `check_named_member_accuracy`) were least able to back that
    verdict up. Every backtick-quoted class cited via the established bullet convention now
    produces a real, named "verification unavailable" finding instead, mirroring
    `check_diagram_verified_format_claims`'s own "absence of corroborating sources disqualifies
    the claim" design -- a fabricated class name in a brand-new product's candidate can no
    longer pass this gate with zero findings.

# preservation audit's Finding 1 (3 internal-tooling classes -- `TaskTokenEstimate`,
# `TaskCompletionReceipt`, `CompletedTaskRecord` -- leaked into the public API Reference table).
# `check_api_reference_classes_exist_in_reference_site` (above) and `check_api_reference_table_
# completeness` (below) both verify a cited class is REAL -- neither has any concept of whether
# a real class is genuinely PUBLIC. Confirmed live: `reporting.py`'s 3 classes are real (defined,
# not forward-declared), never imported by any other file under `src/aspose_font/`, and back
# their own separate `[project.scripts]` console entry (`aspose-font-reporting`) distinct from
# the product's real `aspose-font` entry -- an internal-tooling module, not part of the library's
# own public surface, that both existing checks correctly (and blindly) confirmed as "real."
#
# The precise, validated signal (Stage 1's own 5-control-pair test): internal FAN-IN, not
# `__init__.py` absence alone. A naive "not in __init__.py's __all__" scan was tried first and
# rejected -- it produced 0 to 237 "not exported" classes across every real Python product in
# the portfolio, an unusable false-positive rate, since most legitimate deep API surface is
# reachable only via submodule import, never top-level re-export (the real `FontConverter`
# control case: absent from `__all__`, genuinely real, 6 real internal importers). Python-first
# for this pass (TC-HARDEN-01's own established "prove one language first, disclose the rest as
# deferred" precedent) -- heuristic tier, not a hard gate, validated against exactly one
# product's 5 real control pairs so far (Stage 12's portfolio dry run is real, deterministic
# machinery verification, not a second-language precision proof).

    working exactly as before. A two-level submodule init that isn't really a namespace-package
    root (e.g. a hypothetical `src/mypackage/utils/__init__.py`) can also match this new pattern
    and get its own local names folded into the same export set -- an accepted, disclosed
    imprecision: per this module's own established principle for `_module_internal_fan_in`, a
    stray extra name in `root_exports` only makes the heuristic that consumes this value MORE

    reference_classes_exist_in_reference_site` (the curated-bullet convention only, never the

    which is absent from `_find_top_level_init_exports`' result, as a "possible internal-only
    class -- verify before shipping" prompt.

    Scope is deliberately narrowed to classes `reference_index` (`parse_reference_api_index`'s
    own output) already independently confirms as real -- fabricated-name detection is `check_
    api_reference_classes_exist_in_reference_site`'s job, not this one's; conflating the two
    would re-flag an already-caught fabrication under a confusing, unrelated reason string.
    Silently returns `[]` (never a false positive) when `clone_cache_root` is absent/unusable,
    when the API Reference section/table is empty, or when `reference_index` has nothing to
    confirm any cited class against.

    Heuristic tier, not a hard gate -- validated against exactly one product's 5 real control
    pairs at introduction (`reporting.py`'s 3 real leaked classes vs. `converter.py`/
    `FontConverter`, `_io.py`/`BinaryReader`, `eot/font.py`/`EotFont`, `web.py`/`WebFontAsset`).
    MT048 (note/python pilot, 2026-08-15) is this heuristic's first real run against a SECOND
    product's real content, per this incident's own explicit "not yet exercised against real
    content from any other product" disclosure -- and found a real, confirmed false-positive
    class: `note/python`'s `AsposeNoteError` (a genuinely public base exception, zero cross-file
    fan-in, absent from `__all__`, but the base of 5 real, all-exported subclasses defined in the
    same file) trips the original fan-in-only signal exactly like a real internal-tooling leak
    would. `_class_has_exported_subclass_in_same_file` (below) closes this specific, real,
    evidence-backed false-positive shape without weakening the original `reporting.py`-style
    positive control (which has no exported subclasses at all, so the new exemption never fires
    for it) -- portfolio-wide precision otherwise remains genuinely unproven beyond these two real
    products, per this plan's own "prove precision at scale before hardening" discipline (the
    TC-HARDEN-32 precedent).

    `exclusions` (added MT048): a second, real, confirmed defect found this same incident -- the
    finding's own `reason` text has ALWAYS told the reader to "record a confirmed internal class
    in data/api_reference_class_exclusions.json to suppress this prompt permanently," but this
    function never actually accepted or consulted that file (only `check_api_reference_table_
    completeness`'s unrelated `missing_class` requirement did) -- a real, live-confirmed case of a
    finding message promising a mechanism that did not exist. `exclusions` (a `set[str]` of class
    names, same shape `check_api_reference_table_completeness` already uses) now makes that
    promise true: a cited class present in `exclusions` is skipped before any fan-in/export check
    runs, exactly like the analogous mirror-fidelity gate already does.

    has no concept of duplication WITHIN the candidate's own table. A real clean-room
    regeneration pilot found a real instance this check exists to catch: `cells/cpp`'s
    regenerated Enumerations table listed `DiagnosticSeverity` twice, verbatim, back-to-back --
    it passed `check_api_reference_table_completeness` cleanly (both occurrences are legitimate
    against the reference index; duplication is a separate, orthogonal defect).

    Reuses `_parse_readme_api_tables` (returns `{module: [class_name, ...]}` as a LIST, not a
    set -- duplicates within one module's own rows survive the parse, not silently collapsed) --
    no new table-parsing logic needed. An exact class-name duplicate within the same module's
    table is mechanically unambiguous, never a judgment call, so this is a hard gate, not a
    heuristic; two rows sharing the same DESCRIPTION text but different class names is not a

    """Hard gate (2026-08-08, Rule 1). A bare (non-extension) format-name word must use one

    `{"XLSX": "XLSX", "PDF": "PDF", "HTML": "HTML"}`), that casing must match the registry's
    canonical form.

    Scope, stated precisely: only bare, standalone format words in PROSE are checked -- a
    dotted file-extension reference (`.xlsx`, `.msg`) is a separate, legitimate, always-
    lowercase convention (the literal on-disk suffix) and is never compared against the
    bare form; a markdown link TARGET (the `(...)` half of `[text](target)`, e.g. the bare
    filename `(LICENSE)`) and inline-code spans (`` `Xlsx` ``) are stripped before scanning
    entirely, since those are filename/identifier references, not prose format-name claims
    -- a real false positive found via this function's own test suite: the link target
    `(LICENSE)` (all-caps, a filename) was being compared against prose "License" as if
    they were the same format-name claim. Candidate words are further limited to those that
    are either a known registry format OR appear genuinely all-caps at least once in the
    remaining prose (a strong signal of being treated as an acronym/format name, not
    ordinary text) -- this is load-bearing, not decorative: an unrestricted bare-word scan
    would flag ordinary sentence-initial capitalization ("The" vs. "the") as a false
    "casing inconsistency" on every common English word.

    69-finding portfolio audit found the "multiple different casings of the same bare word"
    branch (the `elif` below, for words with NO canonical registry entry) produces a 63%
    false-positive rate from two confirmed, distinct mechanisms, both concentrated inside the
    `## API Reference` section's MT028 table-and-bullet content: (a) a Title-Case `###`/`####`
    module heading (e.g. `### Css`, `### Dom`, mirroring `reference.aspose.org`'s own real
    module names) colliding with the SAME word used correctly, all-caps, in ordinary body
    prose elsewhere -- heading text was never excluded from this scan; (b) a real, deliberately
    dual-cased technical identifier documented inside a table description cell (a Word
    field-code keyword like `DATA`/`IF`, a PDF content-stream operator mnemonic like `sc`/`SC`,
    an emphatic English word used for emphasis inside a description like "do NOT match") that
    happens to share its spelling, in the opposite case, with an unrelated ordinary-English use
    of the same word elsewhere in the file. Excluding heading lines AND the whole `## API
    Reference` section from THIS branch's occurrence map closes both mechanisms -- verified
    against the real 12-product corpus to drop the false-positive count from 43 to 0 while
    leaving the ~24 genuine `canonical_casing`-branch findings (commercial-SDK PascalCase
    spelling like `Docx`/`Pdf`/`Html` leaking into that same table's description-cell prose,
    uncorrected against this repo's own established all-caps canonical form) completely
    unaffected -- that branch is UNCHANGED and still scans the FULL document, including the API
    Reference section, since it must keep catching drift there; only the no-canonical-entry
    `elif` branch narrows its own text.

    """Hard gate (2026-08-09, Fourteenth incident / MT029, Items 1+3). Real, confirmed defect:
    a 30-product portfolio scan found 7 of 30 (23%) README candidates carrying forensic
    upstream-defect detail (exact error text, exact file/module counts, exact reproduction
    steps) that duplicates a real, matching entry already correctly recorded in the sibling
    `upstream-issues.md` -- in two structural forms, an explicit `> **Known issue:**`
    blockquote (`tex/python`, `cells/go`) and plain bold-lead-in prose with no blockquote at
    all (`3d/python`, `3d/java`, `3d/typescript`, `slides/java`, `words/net`). The prior
    defense, `check_process_narration_smells`, is a fixed historical phrase blocklist --
    structurally reactive, unable to catch a new incident phrased differently. This check is
    structural instead: it cross-references the README against upstream-issues.md's own real,
    structured entries (`_extract_upstream_issue_fingerprints`) rather than matching wording.

    A paragraph (fenced code blocks and the `## API Reference` section excluded -- real class
    names legitimately recur there without describing the defect) is flagged only when it
    contains 2 or more fingerprint tokens from the SAME upstream-issues.md entry -- a single
    shared token is not enough (see `_extract_upstream_issue_fingerprints`'s own docstring).

    No-op (empty findings) when `upstream_issues_text` is empty/absent, or has no entries with
    extractable fingerprints (e.g. a "No upstream issues identified." file) -- nothing to leak.

    Remediation is not always deletion: a real, actionable blocking command (e.g. `words/net`'s
    real NU1101 build failure) still needs a plain, non-forensic pointer sentence in context
    (matching `html/python`'s already-correct "see upstream-issues.md for the root cause"
    pattern) -- only the forensic *specificity* must never appear in the README itself.

    `## Installation` and `## Quick Start` are excluded from scanning, alongside `## API
    Reference` -- found necessary live during this check's own Phase 1 pilot rollout
    (`cells/cpp`): these sections exist specifically to give real, accurate instructions using
    real package/file names, so legitimate overlap with an upstream-issues.md entry's own
    evidence (which cites those same real names) is structurally expected there, not
    suspicious -- unlike Scope and Limitations or Development and Testing prose, whose job is
    to describe facts *about* the product, not to *be* a real, necessarily-specific set of
    instructions. `check_no_undisclosed_blocking_commands` already separately and more
    precisely guards the one real risk specific to these two sections (an undisclosed BLOCKING
    command shipped verbatim); this check's own job is prose narration, not exact commands.

    list -- 5 of 6 were prose paragraphs, and the 1 real exception (`pdf/net`) already showed
    the target shape: a bulleted list (optionally with bold category sub-labels once there are
    enough items to group) followed by a plain-prose closing paragraph linking the Enterprise
    Edition. This check enforces that shape portfolio-wide -- it does not invent a new format,
    it generalizes the one real product that already had it right.

    Findings:
    - `not_a_list`: the section has non-bullet, non-Enterprise-paragraph prose -- the old
      prose-paragraph shape (a limitation claim written as a sentence instead of a `- ` line).
    - `enterprise_paragraph_is_bulleted`: the closing Enterprise-mention content is itself a
      bullet -- violates the user's explicit "this para should remain as it is" instruction
      (a plain paragraph, not absorbed into the limitations list).
    - `missing_enterprise_paragraph`: no plain-prose paragraph linking a real
      `products.aspose.com` Enterprise Edition URL follows the limitations list.
    - `invented_filler`: the section states, in any wording, that no limitations exist (e.g.
      "no known limitations") -- 2026-08-13, the cells/cpp upstream-issues.md-leak healing
      pass's own governing policy: when no verified public limitation exists, the bulleted
      list is simply absent (see the zero-bullet carve-out below), never filled with a
      sentence asserting the absence -- that sentence is itself unverifiable manufactured
      content, the same defect class as citing an internal finding.

    Zero-bullet carve-out (2026-08-13): a section with NO `- ` lines is `not_a_list` only if
    it also has prose beyond the closing Enterprise paragraph. A section whose only non-bullet
    content IS the Enterprise-paragraph sentence(s) is the valid shape for "no verified public
    limitation exists for this product" -- omitting the bulleted list is correct there, not a
    format violation, and must never be confused with the old prose-paragraph-limitations shape
    this check exists to reject.

    Bug fix (2026-08-15, MT045 / Thirty-Fifth incident, TC-HARDEN-68): bullet/non-bullet
    classification now goes through `_iter_leak_scan_units` (the same, already-hardened
    bullet-with-its-own-continuation-lines grouping this module already built for
    `check_no_upstream_issue_leaked_into_readme`, TC-HARDEN-38) instead of raw, un-grouped
    physical lines. The prior implementation stripped blank lines and classified each
    PHYSICAL line independently -- so a bullet's own wrapped continuation line (no `- `
    prefix of its own) landed in `non_bullet_lines` even when it was really the tail of a
    bulleted Limitations item, letting an Enterprise-link sentence appended directly to a
    bullet (no blank line first) silently read as `enterprise_in_prose=True`/
    `enterprise_in_bullet=False` -- the exact combination this check exists to catch, and
    confirmed live to have missed `barcode/python`'s real, exact defect (the Enterprise
    sentence embedded as a continuation of the "PDF rendering is not implemented" bullet).
    A naive "just group continuation lines" fix alone (without `_iter_leak_scan_units`'s own
    blank-line-first paragraph split) was directly simulated and shown to false-positive on
    `email/python`'s and `pdf/cpp`'s own already-correct, genuinely blank-line-separated
    Enterprise paragraphs -- reusing the whole function, not reimplementing half of it, is
    what keeps both directions correct.

# narrower slice than "everything worth preserving in the old upstream README." A real 5-product
# survey (words/net, pdf/cpp, slides/java, email/cpp, note/python) confirmed a genuine,
# reproducible gap: mechanism-level explanations embedded in feature bullets (e.g. pdf/cpp's
# real font-fallback rationale, "so glyphs render even in fontless Linux/CI containers") and
# branding/positioning claims ("Official Aspose project") were silently compressed to bare facts
# or dropped without a trace, invisible to check_dropped_content because neither is a link or a
# heading. Per the user's own decision (AskUserQuestion, 2026-08-09): pure narrative/origin-
# story/CTA prose (a third pattern found in the same survey -- "Star it (star emoji)", "not set
# in stone") stays explicitly out of scope, same as today -- "verified against product repo"
# naturally scopes to checkable facts, not opinion/tone with nothing to verify against source.

# verified reason) -- finally making real what `dropped_claims.json` only ever promised as a

    origin story is a blank-line-delimited paragraph; pdf/cpp's font-fallback rationale and
    note/python's pypdf dependency both live inside single bullet lines).

    Heading lines (of any level -- already owned by `_HEADING_RE`/`_old_readme_inventory` for
    H2/H3, and an old README's H1 title needs no separate tracking), fenced code blocks, and
    badge-row lines are stripped before segmentation. Reuses `_iter_leak_scan_units`'s proven
    paragraph-vs-pure-bulleted-block splitting logic rather than reimplementing it. A unit with no
    word of 4+ letters is dropped as noise (a stray short word, a lone "---", punctuation-only
    fragments) -- deliberately NOT a flat character-count floor. A prior `len(excerpt) < 25`
    version of this filter was found live during MT030 Phase 2 (2026-08-10) to silently drop real,
    substantive short capability-list bullets -- confirmed on 2 products independently:

    correctly dropping the original noise cases ("---" has zero letters; "Ok." has only "Ok", 2
    letters).

    existing sorted link/heading lists already do. Category-1 (narrative/CTA) content is NOT
    excluded here -- every unit, however obviously narrative, still needs a real disposition
    entry; see `_likely_category_1_signal`'s own docstring for why that classification stays a

    a capital letter, digit, backtick, or quote. Deliberately does NOT split on a bare `. `
    followed by a lowercase letter, to avoid cutting mid-sentence on an abbreviation or an inline
    code fragment -- and, for the same reason, does NOT split right after `e.g.`/`i.e.`/`etc.`
    even when what follows is capitalized/backtick/quoted (real, confirmed live: `cells/go`'s own
    `u0014`, "...(e.g. `\"A1\"`, `\"B2\"`) ... (e.g. `[0, 0]`) are not supported", would otherwise
    wrongly split after each `e.g.` purely because a backtick immediately follows -- one bullet
    describing one limitation, not 2 bundled facts). A single-sentence excerpt (the large majority
    of real dispositions) still produces exactly one group, so the caller's per-group check
    degenerates to the pre-existing "any one token, anywhere in the excerpt" behavior, unchanged.

    Requiring sentence-terminal punctuation immediately before the split point -- rather than
    treating every embedded `\n` as an unconditional boundary -- was NOT the first design tried,
    and the first design's failure is worth recording: a bare `\n+` split (this incident's
    original portfolio-sweep pass, MT049/Thirty-Ninth incident) correctly separates `note/
    python`'s own captured `u0020` (each of its 2 embedded `\n`s genuinely IS a distinct-fact
    boundary, confirmed by direct reading) -- but a live portfolio sweep against real disposition
    data immediately surfaced `\n` being used for other, non-fact-boundary purposes that an
    unconditional split wrongly treated as compound: `barcode/python`'s own `u0005` wraps a SINGLE
    sentence mid-clause ("...run from\nthe repository root..." -- lowercase word right after the
    `\n`); `3d/java`'s own `u0010` separates a bold heading fragment ("**Excluded APIs:**") from
    markdown bullet items with `\n-`; `words/python`'s own `u0015` is a markdown table with one
    `\n`-delimited row per line. None of these are a compound bundle of separate facts -- they are
    ordinary source-text line-wrapping/list/table structure -- and the unconditional split wrongly
    fragmented each into multiple sentence-groups, producing real false positives (confirmed by
    direct manual re-reading of all 3 against their real target sections before this fix, not
    assumed). The single unified rule here -- ANY whitespace, `\n` included, only counts as a
    split point when the text immediately before it ends with `.`/`!`/`?` -- fixes this: a
    mid-clause line-wrap, a heading-to-bullet `\n`, and a table-row `\n` never sit after
    terminal punctuation, so none of them split; `u0020`'s own 2 embedded `\n`s each DO sit right
    after a real terminal `.`, so both still correctly split, preserving detection of the real
    captured defect this incident closes.

    """Hard gate. For every `merged_verbatim`/`merged_reframed` disposition, confirms the cited
    `target_section` was genuinely touched with something traceable to THIS unit -- at least one
    of its `salient_tokens` appears (case-insensitive) in that section's real body (via
    `_split_into_sections`; `target_section` of `"Intro"` or `"Project History"` (2026-08-10,
    MT031) both map to the `"__preamble__"` key, since the optional H3 `### Project History`
    section sits before the first `##` heading, alongside the unheaded Intro paragraph). This
    is the actual "reuse, not just presence-check" enforcement -- it cannot verify faithfulness
    of a reframe, only that the section was not silently left untouched while claiming a merge
    happened.

    A unit with zero extracted `salient_tokens` (plain narrative prose with no backtick/CamelCase/
    version/quoted identifiers -- common for a `redundant_with_existing` claim, since the whole
    point of "redundant" is that the SAME fact is phrased differently in two places) falls back to
    significant-word overlap: at least half of the excerpt's 4+-letter words (case-insensitive,
    reusing `check_section_job_distinctness`'s own established word-set-overlap idiom) must appear
    in the target section's body. Broadened from an earlier leading-20-char literal substring
    fallback (found live 2026-08-09, real portfolio data across all 5 MT030 Phase 1 pilot
    products): a literal substring almost never survives genuine rephrasing, so that fallback
    false-positived on dozens of real, individually source-verified redundant claims whose target
    section legitimately uses different wording for the same fact -- confirmed by manually
    re-reading a sample of the flagged entries against their real target sections before
    broadening this, not assumed.

    ALSO verifies an `excluded`/`redundant_with_existing` entry whose `verification.evidence_
    type == "candidate_section_reference"` -- the section named in `verification.evidence_ref`
    (not `target_section`, which is null for excluded entries) must genuinely contain the unit's
    trace, same token/word-overlap logic as a merge. Real, confirmed gap (found live 2026-08-09,
    MT030 Phase 1, independently by 2 of 5 pilot agents on words/net and slides/java):
    `check_content_unit_evidence_resolves` intentionally treats `candidate_section_reference` as
    always-resolved, deferring the real check to THIS function -- but this function originally
    only ever looked at `merged_*` dispositions, so a `redundant_with_existing` claim's cited
    section was never actually checked by either function. A lazy or wrong "already covered in
    section X" claim on an excluded entry would previously pass every hard gate undetected.

    ALSO (TC-HARDEN-78, MT047/Thirty-Seventh incident, 2026-08-15) catches the free-text SIBLING
    of that same shape: an `excluded` entry whose `excluded_reason`/`classification_basis` names
    a target the structured way -- "the candidate['s own] <section name> ... independently
    states/names/covers ..." -- WITHOUT using `verification.evidence_type ==
    "candidate_section_reference"` at all (`evidence_type` is `"clone_cache_path"` instead,
    since the entry's real verification is against the SOURCE, not the candidate). Real,
    confirmed gap: `font/python`'s own current `content-dispositions.json` has exactly 4 entries
    in this shape (`u0001`, `u0006`, `u0028`, `u0049`), each self-disclosing in its own
    `classification_basis` that this claim is "not tracked as a formal verbatim/reframed merge
    to avoid over-claiming exact wording traceability" -- which also means it was never
    mechanically re-validated. `u0028`'s cited claim ("the candidate's own Key Capabilities intro
    paragraph independently states the same 'variable-font-first' framing") went stale after an
    unrelated MT046 edit deleted that intro paragraph entirely, with zero detection until this
    extension closed the gap. `_normalize_independent_statement_target` strips the free text's
    own trailing descriptive word ("section"/"paragraph"/"bullets"/"intro") to recover the real
    heading name.

    Resolution for this new free-text shape deliberately does NOT reuse the excerpt-word-overlap
    fallback below -- found live this incident, against font/python's own real, current
    candidate: a 50%-of-excerpt-words bar (calibrated for a MERGED unit, where the target section
    is expected to closely restate the excerpt) badly over-fires here, since an "independently
    states" claim's own excerpt is routinely a much longer, differently-structured original
    sentence than the compressed phrase actually echoed in the candidate -- it flagged all 4 real
    entries, including `u0001`/`u0049`, which this incident's own Stage 1 re-verification directly
    confirmed are still genuinely accurate. Instead: extract the free text's own quoted phrase
    (the parenthetical `'...'`/`"..."` span the real authoring convention already uses to name the
    exact restated fact, e.g. `u0001`'s `('zero required third-party runtime dependencies')`) and
    require it, hyphen/whitespace-normalized, to appear as a contiguous substring of the target
    section body -- a stricter, more precise test than word-overlap, matching the real, tighter
    resemblance a genuinely-accurate quoted restatement has to its own claim. Confirmed against
    all 3 of font/python's own real, distinctly-shaped quoted claims: `u0001`'s and `u0049`'s both
    resolve (still present, contiguous, verbatim modulo the hyphen/space difference the original
    source's own compound-word styling introduces); `u0028`'s does not (the phrase is genuinely
    gone). A free-text claim with no quoted phrase at all (e.g. a bare parenthetical list with no
    quote marks) falls back to the same excerpt-word-overlap logic the merge/candidate_section_
    reference paths already use below -- a real, disclosed weaker guarantee for that narrower
    shape, not a silent skip.

    ALSO (MT049, Thirty-Ninth incident, 2026-08-15) closes a real, captured gap in the salient-
    tokens path itself, above and independent of the free-text extension: this check's "at least
    one of the unit's salient_tokens appears in the target section" test was originally evaluated
    against the excerpt as a whole. For a COMPOUND excerpt -- several genuinely distinct sentences/
    facts bundled into one `content_unit`, joined by real sentence breaks (a `.`/`!`/`?` followed
    by whitespace -- a plain space or an embedded `\n`, same rule either way -- and then a capital
    letter; see `_split_excerpt_into_sentence_groups`'s own docstring for why a bare `\n` alone is
    NOT used as the split signal) -- that whole-excerpt test could pass on the strength of ONE
    bundled fact's token surviving into
    the merge while a DIFFERENT bundled fact was silently dropped, with zero detection. Real,
    captured case: `note/python`'s own `u0020` (fixed directly in the candidate as part of this same
    incident, not reproduced here) bundles 3 sentences -- golden-PDF storage/manifest comparison,
    cross-platform stability via ReportLab, and the PDF writer's deterministic-Base-14-fonts-by-
    default behavior with its `ASPOSE_NOTE_PDF_USE_SYSTEM_FONTS=1` override -- under 6 shared
    `salient_tokens`. The prior candidate state carried forward only the first fact; this check
    still passed, because the token `"tests/goldens/pdf/"` (that first fact's own token) legitimately
    matched -- with no way to notice the third fact's own distinctive token
    (`ASPOSE_NOTE_PDF_USE_SYSTEM_FONTS=1`) was never written anywhere in the candidate.

    Fix: `_split_excerpt_into_sentence_groups` splits the excerpt into per-sentence groups (a
    single-sentence excerpt -- the large majority of real dispositions -- still produces exactly
    one group). Each of the unit's `salient_tokens` is assigned to every group it structurally
    occurs in, via `_token_occurs_standalone` (not a plain substring test -- see that helper's own
    docstring for why a generic token like `PDF` must not be credited to a sentence purely because
    it is embedded inside a DIFFERENT, longer sibling token's text there). Any token that occurs in
    none of the groups (e.g. sourced from outside the excerpt's own literal text) is treated as one
    more, whole-excerpt-scoped group, preserving today's behavior for that edge case. The check then
    requires EVERY group that has at least one of its own tokens to have at least one of THOSE
    tokens match somewhere in the target section body -- not just any token from anywhere in the
    excerpt. A single-sentence excerpt collapses to exactly one group, so this is provably identical
    to the pre-existing "any one token, anywhere" behavior for that common case -- the actual body-
    side match test itself (`tok.lower() in body.lower()`) is completely unchanged, so no already-
    tuned single-fact disposition's tolerance for legitimate partial-token-survival paraphrasing is
    affected.

    Deliberately NOT a naive uniform stricter threshold (e.g. "require 50% of tokens to match" for
    every entry): this function's own history above (the leading-20-char-literal-substring fallback
    that had to be loosened after false-positiving on dozens of real, correctly-reframed single-fact
    dispositions) is exactly the failure mode a uniform tightening would risk reintroducing for the
    large majority of simple, single-sentence entries. The per-sentence-group split targets ONLY the
    specific, evidenced defect shape (a compound excerpt silently losing one of its bundled facts)
    without changing behavior for anything else. The `excerpt_words`/`body_words` 50%-overlap
    fallback below (for units with no `salient_tokens` at all) is deliberately left untouched by this
    extension -- it already has its own separately-tuned, looser tolerance for paraphrasing, and no
    live compound-excerpt-with-zero-tokens case has been found to justify the added complexity.

# `## Project Structure` section that is ENTIRELY a fenced directory-tree code block with no
# surrounding prose. `extract_old_readme_content_units` strips ALL fenced code before
# segmenting (by design -- it extracts sentence-level prose facts, not code), so this section
# produced zero content units and was never merged, never excluded-with-reason -- structurally
# invisible to the whole MT030 verify-and-merge pipeline. `check_dropped_content` DOES detect
# the heading as dropped, but that finding is downgraded to non-blocking advisory the moment a
# real content-dispositions.json exists (TC-HARDEN-04), on a theory that's false for any unit
# the extractor never captured in the first place. This section closes that gap with a second,
# parallel extraction mechanism for STRUCTURAL (non-prose) sections, plus a real badge
# semantic-reconciliation mechanism (previously nonexistent) for the sibling "product-specific
# badges get lost or wrongly deduplicated" defect the same mission named as a general problem.
#
# Two new sibling disposition files, agent-authored, same tier as content-dispositions.json:
# structure-dispositions.json, badge-dispositions.json. NOT an extension of content-
# dispositions.json's own schema -- its `classification` enum (narrative/mechanism/branding/
# history/redundant) has no honest value for "a directory tree" or "a badge dedup decision."
# Both key entries on `unit_id` specifically so `check_content_unit_evidence_resolves` -- which
# only ever reads `verification.status/evidence_type/evidence_ref` and echoes back `unit_id` --
# can be reused UNCHANGED as the evidence-resolution gate for both, a real, load-bearing reuse.

    Gating test, deliberately content-SHAPE-based rather than a heading-keyword match (the
    mission's own explicit requirement: "Repository Layout"/"Source Layout"/"Project Structure"
    must all be recognized identically, never discarded for using a different heading than a
    template expects). For every H2/H3 heading (`_HEADING_RE`), a section becomes a structural

    own fenced-code-stripped body yields ZERO real prose units -- i.e. the existing prose
    extractor genuinely has nothing to say about it -- and (b) fenced code accounts for >=
    `min_fenced_dominance` (default 60%) of the section's real non-blank lines. Both conditions
    matter: (a) alone would also flag a section with one throwaway short line; (b) alone would
    incorrectly flag "## Installation" (fenced-code-heavy but with real leftover prose -- the
    real `cells/go` case: "Requires Go 1.18+..." is exactly this discriminating survivor,

    real portfolio-scale confirmation before being treated as a permanent constant, the same
